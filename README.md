# pynterlocking
An (non safe) Interlocking Kernel written in python3

# Why?
I am currently working on my new kitchen-sink project - a working (but non-safe) interlocking kernel in python3. I want to create all necessary Infrastructure-Elements and a working route-logic. If that is done, I'll try to create a UI

# Features
## Create Elements
Currently, it is possible to create:
- Generic Elements
- Tracks
- Points
- Generic Light Signals
- Main Signals
- Shunting Signals
- Distant Signals
- Protection Signals
- Signal Repeaters
- Level Crossings
- Routes

Each Element has it's unique but basic properties.

## Route Setting
is in Progress:
- Check if Train, or Shunting Route
- Search for distinct standard-route or detour-route


## Planned
  - Importer for JSON-Topology
  - Flank Protection
  - Route Protection
